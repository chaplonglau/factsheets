What is MVC?

MVC stands for Model, View, and Controller. It is an architectural design pattern that we
use to build and organize our web applications.

When a user makes a request to our web application, the controller relays that request to the appropriate model. Models have most of the application logic. The model receives the request and consequently compiles a response. The response is given back to the controller to be given to a view. The view's sole purpose is to render the response for the user.

In general - Model:Logic, View:Output, Controller:Pathing
